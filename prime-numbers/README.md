# Prime Numbers
Given a number `n`, print all the prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.
## Example
Given `n = 20`, your program should print the numbers `2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 ` 
## Testing your code
You can verify your solution (if you used Java) for `n = 1000` like so:
```$ javac MySolution.java```<br>
```$ java MySolution 1000 | diff - primes-leq-1000.txt```<br>
