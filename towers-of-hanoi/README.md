# Towers of Hanoi
This is a classic problem in computer science that relates to the fundamental concept of *recursion*,
which you should try to understand and interpret if you're going into software engineering.<br>
The truth is that we don't use recursion a whole lot in practice, but a lot of problems can<br>
be described recursively, such as the one we're about to show, and then solved in an iterative fashion.<br>
## The Problem
(just cite Knuth here in describing it)
## Challengge 1
Write a program that solves it recursively.
## Challenge 2
Prove that your program will run in 2^n-1 steps.
